### Context connections
Expanding and zooming into each context we see that the [“Device Driver”](/usage/device_driver.md) block in the “Software Context” is connected to the [“VSI Common Interface”](/usage/VSI_common_interface.md) in the Hardware Context. This describes the connectivity between the two contexts. The connection represents a logical connection between the two contexts and allows the VSI system compiler to determine the connectivity.
