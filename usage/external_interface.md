## Interfacing with an External Systems

### External Interfaces

Visual System Integrator generated binaries can be used as subsystem of a larger system. During design, any unconnected interface can be marked as `external interface` which exposes it to an external system. In order to interface to the `external interface`, VSI provides various options suitable for any type of external system. Here we will list down the options that are available out of the box:

- [API](/usage/api.md)
- [TCP Ports](/usage/tcp.md)
- [RESTful API](/usage/rest.md)
